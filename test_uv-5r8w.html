      <p>This is my test of Baofeng UV-5R (8W version) acquired in 2025. It is a (supposedly) higher output power version of the well known UV-5R, but based on the quality of the model plate I suspect it might be a rebrand/counterfeit.</p>
      <p>This radio is immensely popular due to its low price and is actually the radio that got a lot of people into the hobby. Being an older model, it probably went through multiple (undocumented) revisions so the results of my unit might not reflect the performance of any other unit.</p>
      <p><em>Review coming soon....</em></p>
