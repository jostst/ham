      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>This is my test of Baofeng UV-5R (8W version) acquired in 2025. It is a (supposedly) higher output power version of the well known UV-5R, but based on the quality of the model plate I suspect it might be a rebrand/counterfeit.</p>
          <p>This radio is immensely popular due to its low price and is actually the radio that got a lot of people into the hobby. Being an older model, it probably went through multiple (undocumented) revisions so the results of my unit might not reflect the performance of any other unit.</p>

          <h2>VHF (2 m band) measurements</h2>
          <p>Measurements of emission spectra at the feedpoint. Frequency is 144.6 MHz.</p>
          <h3>Low power</h3>

          </div>
          <p><em>At low power, the harmonics are well below the -13 dBm and actually below -60 dBc, which is excellent. A problematic birdie is present at about 217 MHz, which is not a harmonic but rather a true spurious emission. There is a hint of another spurious emission at about 72 MHz on the far left part of the spectrum. This birdie is examined in more details later on.</em></p>
          <h3>Mid power</h3>
          <div class="text-center">

          </div>
          <p><em>Increasing the power to medium, the spurious emission disappears at the 217 MHz, but the emission at the 72 MHz remains, although at a low power well below -20 dBm. This is also examined in more detail later.</em></p>
          <h3>High power</h3>

          <h2>UHF (70 cm band) measurements</h2>
          <p>These are the measurements of emission spectra at the feedpoint. Frequency is 432.5 MHz.</p>
          <h3>Low power</h3>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="img/uv5r8w/UV5R-UHF-L.png" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="UHF low power">
          </div>
          <p><em>At UHF, some harmonics appear. Upon increasing the attenuation, only the 7th harmonic above 3 GHz is present. It is below the legal requirements and this is also in the part where TinySA is not perfectly linear any more so it might be partially generated within the instrument itself. According to the guidelines, this harmonic is small; it is further not problematic, because no antenna for VHF and UHF is likely to radiate efficientely at this frequency. Furthermore, the -40 dB attenuator used in the testing is rated up to 3 GHz so results above this are non-reliable at best.</em></p>
          <h3>Mid power</h3>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="img/uv5r8w/UV5R-UHF-M.png" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="UHF mid power">
          </div>
          <p><em>At medium power setting, the 2nd harmonic along with the 6th, 7th and 8th are visible, but they are below the -13 dBm limit. The 7th and 8th harmonic are also in the reduced linearity part of the spectrum of the instrument and above the rated range of the external attenuator.</em></p>
          <h3>High power</h3>
          <div class="text-center">

          </div>
          <p><em>At high power, a weak 2nd harmonic, well below -13 dBm is observed, along with th very weak 6th. On the upper, non-reliable bounds of the measurement interval, 7th harmonic is still present, but again below the -13 dBm limit.</em></p>

          <h2>VHF spurious emission analysis</h2>
          <p>The spurious emissions in VHF at low power were examined further. The emissions were tested at two different frequencies at low power and at the primary testing frequency at mid power. The range and resolution of TinySA were increased for better evaluation.</p>

          <p><em>There are in fact two birdies. One is independent of the frequency at approximateiy 72 Hz. This could be PLL artefact, assuming that the reference oscillator of the PLL syntehsizer has frequency of 36 Mhz. This number is present in some unofficial sources, but 26 MHz can also be found. This is further substantiated by the second birdie, which changes the frequency with change in fundamental frequency. It appears approximately at the sum of the fundamental and the 72 MHz birdie. The signal at 72 MHz remains present even in the mid power setting, but the amplitude is decreased below legal requirements for compliance. At mid power, the emission at the sum of frequencies vanishes completely.</em></p>

          <h3>Power measurements</h3>
          <p>Power was measured using the TinySA, which outputs results in dBm. This is easy to convert to W. Advertised power of the handheld is <em>8W</em>. Results are collected in the following table. We take the highest measured value here.</p>

          <h3>Harmonic suppresion</h3>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Although the harmonic supression satisfied the CEPT-derived standards for S5, the birdie at low VHF power indicates an overall grade of fail. The HT is still usable, but low power should not be used and the overall legality of the station is questionable. An important caveat is that the unit teste might not be an original Baofeng and this testing reflects only the condition of my tested unit.</p>
