          <p>This is my test of Baofeng UV-5R Mini acquired in 2025.</p>
          <p>The Baofeng UV-5R Mini is a compact version of the popular UV-5R series, designed for portability while maintaining essential features for amateur radio enthusiasts. It has an added bluetooth capability (which I have never used).</p>
          <p>I like it for its small size, dual PTT buttons and USB-C charging and I have been EDCing it for the last 6 months. The reception quality is reasonable, but it can get overloaded. This is especially obvious when using a high-gain antenna, such as an original Diamond SRJ-77. I achieved the best results for this radio with cheap antennas, which have a reasonable reception but without any gain. Generally, they do not overload the frontend and thus achieve better results.</p>

          <p><em>Measurements show some harmonics. Increasing the attenuation in TinySA decreases the harmonic 5, which is probably generated internally. The 2nd and 3rd harmonics are below the -13 dBm so it appears to be compliant. Sweep of the whole range shows no other spurious emissions within the measurement range.</em></p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The Baofeng UV-5R Mini performs adequately in terms of spurious emissions on both VHF and UHF bands. While some harmonics are present, they remain below the regulatory limits, indicating compliance. However, users should be aware of potential frontend overload issues, especially when using high-gain antennas. Overall, the UV-5R Mini is a compact and functional choice for amateur radio enthusiasts seeking portability without sacrificing essential features.</p>
