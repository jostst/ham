      <p>This is my test of Quansheng UV-K5(8) produced in 2024.</p>
      <p>This radio is rather popular due to its all-band performance (although in my experience it varies across the bands significantly and SHOULD NOT BE USED TO TRANSMIT outside of the 2 m and 70 cm bands), and the ability to flash custom aftermarket firmwares. These custom firmwares enable very nice features, such as spectrum analyzer.</p>
      <p><em>Review coming soon....</em></p>
